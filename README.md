## 🎯 Objective

To model and assemble a **four-cylinder engine** to understand the mechanical interaction and structural design of key internal components in a combustion engine system.

---

## 🧩 Components Designed

- Cylinder Block  
- Pistons  
- Connecting Rods  
- Crankshaft  
- Connecting Rod Pins  

All components were designed **to scale** based on actual engine proportions, ensuring accurate mechanical fit and interaction.

## 🔧 Design & Assembly Process

### 1. Component Modeling  
Each engine part was individually modeled using CAD software (e.g., SolidWorks or Fusion 360), based on real-world dimensions and tolerances.

### 2. Assembly Phase  
All parts were assembled using proper **mating constraints** to simulate realistic alignment and interaction. Special care was taken for **rotational and translational movement** accuracy.

### 3. Testing & Troubleshooting  
Minor design refinements were made to eliminate interference and improve part compatibility. Simulations were run to verify dynamic fit and potential motion.

## ✅ Outcomes

- Successfully created a full-scale CAD model of a four-cylinder engine.  
- Improved understanding of mechanical component design and multibody assembly techniques.  
- Demonstrated movement coordination between piston and crankshaft elements.
